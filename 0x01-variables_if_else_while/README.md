## Tasks
1. [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative)
   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether 
   - The number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
2. [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last     digit of the number stored in the variable n.
3. [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5. [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
6. [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)
   - Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/marymutheuthomas/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
