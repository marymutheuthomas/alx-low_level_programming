#0x0B. C - malloc, free

##Concepts
1. Automatic and dynamic memory allocation
-Automatic memory allocation refers to the allocation and deallocation of memory by the compiler or the programming language runtime system. In languages like C and C++, memory for local variables declared inside functions is automatically allocated when the function is called and deallocated when the function returns. This process is handled by the program's call stack.
-Dynamic memory allocation, on the other hand, allows a program to request memory from the system during runtime explicitly. In languages like C and C++, dynamic memory allocation is done using functions like malloc, calloc, or new (in C++). The memory is allocated on the heap, which is a region of memory that is managed separately from the call stack.
